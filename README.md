# Indie Dev Sales

Prime Day 2023 is coming, July 11-12 - people will be in a spending mood, so what better time to offer some deals?

## Are you an Indie Developer?
Interested in joining?  Create a Pull Request with your info, or let me know on [Mastodon](https://indieapps.space/@Matt1Corey).  I'm trying to get to Pull Requests as quickly as I can, but I should be able to add you same day - if it seems slow, just ping me on Mastodon.

A few things that will help:

- Shouldn't need to be said, but please don't alter other people's records (behave!)
- Try to add your entry in Alphabetical order, *BY DEVELOPER*. This should help to avoid most manual merges between different PR's, as changes will be in different parts of the doc.
- Before submitting _and after merging_, please verify that your links are all working. I'll do my best to keep them consistent, but errors may happen.

The Indie Dev's listed below would very much appreciate some coverage, and a follow on social media! 😉🙏❤️
